StickyCode
==========

Why "Sticky" well the sticky conventions let you build applications that don't need glue, it just sticks together, its "Sticky Code"

Sticky Code takes the experience of convention over configuration frameworks and enables it for plain old java

The framework is intended to allow developers to be deliberate all the time and to give them easy obvious decisions to encourage clean code at all times.
